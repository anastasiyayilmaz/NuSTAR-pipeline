1- Search and download your data:

  HEASARC’s archive holds all publicly available data obtained from ASCA, BEPPOSAX, Chandra, Fermi, HST, INTEGRAL, Planck, ROSAT, Spitzer, Suzaku, WMAP, XMM-Newton, CGRO, FUSE, NUSTAR, RXTE and Swift. 
  
  First go to https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/archive.html.

  For simplicity, let’s look at “Browse Mission Interface”, but please explore all the different options. Type in the name of your source and start search:

  Above, each row on the first column from the left gives the names of the available missions for your source. The following columns show the name of the table for that specific mission with how many rows (i.e. data sets) are available. This list will be different for each source.
  
  Now click on any number next to the table you want to access, we’ll look at RXTE for now.

  Click on query Data Products Retrieval, you’ll see the options for you to be able to retrieve your data: 

  Choose “Create Download Script” for datasets larger than 2GB. Copy the commands created to download the data.
  
  Open your terminal from the directory you want to download your data to and past the download commands. Depending on the size of your data, this might take a while. If you want to download the entire set of observations or a large number of rows, you can open multiple tabs on your terminal and divide each line to run simultaneously. This will save you an enormous amount of time.

  Et voilà! You have your data.
